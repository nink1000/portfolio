          Hello and welcome!
          </br>
          </br>
          My name is Nguyễn Quang Huy, and I'm currently a third-year student at HSB (Hanoi School of Business and Management). I'm someone who finds joy in discovering new places, cultures, and experiences – that's why traveling and exploring are such an important part of my life. Whether it's a hidden gem in the countryside or a bustling city abroad, I always enjoy the thrill of the journey and the stories that come with it.
          </br></br>
          Aside from traveling, I have a strong passion for films and classical music. Watching movies allows me to dive into different worlds, emotions, and perspectives, while classical music gives me a sense of peace and inspiration – it's the perfect balance between creativity and calm.
          </br></br>
          This website is a little corner of the internet where I share my interests, experiences, and perhaps some thoughts along the way.
          Thank you for stopping by – I hope you find something here that resonates with you!
